# Student Registration Form and Table in PHP using CRUD Operations

This project is a student registration form and table built in PHP, which uses CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to interact with a MySQL database. The registration form allows users to enter their personal information and academic details, which are stored in a MySQL database. The table displays all the registered students' information, and users can perform CRUD operations on the table.

## Features:

Student Registration Form: Users can enter their personal information (such as name, email, phone number, and address) and academic details (such as college name, course name, and percentage).
MySQL Database: The registration form data is stored in a MySQL database, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval.
Student Table: Displays all the registered students' information, such as name, email, phone number, address, college name, course name, and percentage.
CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete student records from the student table.
